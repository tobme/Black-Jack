## Rules

You compete against the dealer and the goal is to come as close as possible to 21 points. The cards points are equal the number except for J,Q and K which gives 10 points. Ace can be 11 or 1 (players choice). At the start 2 cards are given to you and the dealer, you may 'hit' and take another card or stay on your current points. The dealer has to 'hit' until he gets 17 or more points.

* Blackjack: is when you get an ace and a 10 point card in your first 2 cards and gives you 3 times your bet\n
* Split: : you can split if your 2 first to cards gives the same amount of points, this will cost you your betting money and you will get 2 decks and each deck has a chance to win\
* Insurance: you can insurance if the dealer gets an ace as a first card, this costs 1/2 of your bet and if he gets blackjack your money will be returned\
* Doubling down: will double your bet and give you one more card
